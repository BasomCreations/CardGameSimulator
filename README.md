# CardGameSimulator
This is an application that simulates a card game tournament in order to determine how well you would need to do in order to advance to the second stage.

### How to run
Running the Main program will display the average and median point cutoff scores at the end of stage one.  An interface is provided on the "gui" branch by running the CardGameSimulatorMain program.  This interface requires JavaFX to run.  It allows the user to input settings to change the configurations of the number of simulations, number of rounds for stage one, and the number of qualifiers who advance to round two.  The default settings are 1000 simulations, 7 rounds, and 32 qualifiers.  If no configurations are adjusted, the program will run with the default and display the output as follows:

However, if the user changes the input such as 10 qualifiers in the following example, then we will observe significantly different results as shown below:
